# EMG Bluetooth Communication Project ðŸ’ªðŸ“¡

This project transmits EMG (Electromyography) signals wirelessly using two Arduino Nano 33 BLE boards over Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE).

## ðŸ”§ Files
- `sender.ino`: Reads EMG signals from analog pins and transmits over BLE.
- `receiver.ino`: Receives EMG data and prints it to the Serial Monitor.

## ðŸš€ How to Use
1. Connect EMG signal outputs to A0 and A1 on the sender board.
2. Upload `sender.ino` to one Arduino Nano 33 BLE.
3. Upload `receiver.ino` to the second board.
4. Open Serial Monitor on the receiverâ€™s port to view live EMG data.

## ðŸ“¦ Requirements
- 2x Arduino Nano 33 BLE
- EMG sensor
- Arduino IDE
